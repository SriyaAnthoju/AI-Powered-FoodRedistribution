## üåü Introduction

Food wastage is a significant global issue, particularly in urban areas where restaurants and events often have surplus edible food.Simultaneously, many individuals and communities face food insecurity and hunger.

This project introduces an **AI-Powered Food Redistribution System**, a digital platform that serves as a bridge between food donors (Senders) and receivers like NGOs or shelters (Receivers).Our goal is to redistribute surplus food smartly and efficiently, minimizing waste and supporting sustainable food management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Separate Dashboards:** Dedicated login and dashboard interfaces for both Senders and Receivers.
* **Food Donation Listings:** Senders can easily upload details of surplus food, including type, quantity, shelf life, and optional images.
* **Real-Time Notifications:** Receivers are instantly notified about new, nearby food donations via email (SMTP).
* **AI-Powered Matching:** An intelligent engine matches donations with the most suitable receivers based on location, food type, and preferences.
* **Image Analysis:** A lightweight AI model assesses uploaded images to check for food freshness.
* **Feedback System:** A simple rating and review system allows receivers to provide feedback on donations.
* **Admin Analytics:** An administrative overview panel for tracking all platform activity and generating data analytics.

## üß† Why an AI-Powered System?

The integration of Artificial Intelligence elevates the platform's efficiency and effectiveness:

* **Smart Matching:** Our AI recommends the best receivers for a donation by analyzing historical data, location, and food preferences.We use a `RandomForestRegressor` model from Scikit-learn for this task.
* **Demand Prediction:** The system uses a **Prophet** model to forecast areas that will have a high demand for food at specific times, allowing for proactive planning.
* **Anomaly Detection:** AI helps maintain platform integrity by detecting fraudulent activities or unusual user behavior, such as repeated cancellations, using threshold-based checks.
* **Image Classification:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provides a preliminary check on whether an uploaded food image appears fresh or spoiled.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The platform is built on a modular, layered architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.Each component functions independently while working together to match donors and recipients seamlessly.

* **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React.js**. It handles user registration, login, food upload forms, and donation Browse.
* **Application Layer (Backend):** The core logic is powered by **Django**.It manages user sessions, REST APIs, and business logic, and communicates with the AI engine.
* **AI/ML Engine:** This layer houses our intelligent models for matching, prediction, and detection.
* **Data Layer:** Securely stores all platform data, including user profiles, donations, and ratings, using a **MySQL** database.Food images are managed via cloud or local file storage.
* **Notification Layer:** Handles all user communications, sending real-time alerts about new donations via **SMTP Email**.

## üë• Key Roles

* **Sender (Donor):** An individual or organization with surplus food.Responsibilities include uploading food details (type, quantity, expiry), waiting for confirmation, and handing over the food.
* **Receiver (Acceptor):** An NGO, shelter, or person in need.Responsibilities include Browse and selecting donations, scheduling pickup, and providing feedback after collection.
