##  Introduction

Food wastage is a significant global issue, particularly in urban areas where restaurants and events often have surplus edible food.Simultaneously, many individuals and communities face food insecurity and hunger.

This project introduces an **AI-Powered Food Redistribution System**, a digital platform that serves as a bridge between food donors (Senders) and receivers like NGOs or shelters (Receivers).Our goal is to redistribute surplus food smartly and efficiently, minimizing waste and supporting sustainable food management.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üßë‚Äçüíª Role-Based Authentication
* Separate login and dashboards for:
    * **Senders (Food Donors):** Restaurants, caterers, and individuals with surplus food.
    * **Receivers (NGOs, Shelters, Volunteers):** Those looking to accept donations.

### üç± Food Donation & Claiming System
* Donors can upload details of available food: type, quantity, shelf life, and optional images.
* Receivers can browse and claim available donations.
* Once claimed, the donor receives confirmation for the handover.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Features
* **Smart Matching Engine:** Suggests the best donors for each receiver based on geographic proximity, food type, and historical preferences.
* **Demand Prediction:** Uses a Prophet model to forecast areas likely to need food and identify peak demand times.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitors system behavior to detect fake entries, suspicious cancellations, or platform abuse.

### ‚è∞ System Automation with Celery
* **Automated AI Model Retraining:** The demand prediction models are automatically retrained every day at midnight, ensuring the AI stays up-to-date with the latest data.
* **Scheduled Reminders:** The system automatically sends periodic email reminders for donation pickups and for leaving feedback, managed entirely in the background.

### üó£ Feedback and Review System
* After a donation is picked up, receivers can leave reviews and ratings to encourage trust and transparency.

### üìä Admin Dashboard
* Admins can view all users, donations, claims, and analytics, providing insights into platform activity.

### üîê Secure & Modular Architecture
* Features secure **JWT-based authentication** for the API.
* Built with RESTful APIs, enabling a scalable, microservices-style development approach.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The platform is built on a modular, layered architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability. It uses a task queue (Celery & Redis) to offload heavy processes from the main application thread, resulting in a faster user experience.

##  System Architecture

The platform is built on a modular, layered architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.Each component functions independently while working together to match donors and recipients seamlessly.

* **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React.js**. It handles user registration, login, food upload forms, and donation Browse.
* **Application Layer (Backend):** The core logic is powered by **Django**.It manages user sessions, REST APIs, and business logic, and communicates with the AI engine.
* **AI/ML Engine:** This layer houses our intelligent models for matching, prediction, and detection.
* **Data Layer:** Securely stores all platform data, including user profiles, donations, and ratings, using a **MySQL** database.Food images are managed via cloud or local file storage.
* **Notification Layer:** Handles all user communications, sending real-time alerts about new donations via **SMTP Email**.

    ```

## üë• Key Roles

* **Sender (Donor):** An individual or organization with surplus food.Responsibilities include uploading food details (type, quantity, expiry), waiting for confirmation, and handing over the food.
* **Receiver (Acceptor):** An NGO, shelter, or person in need.Responsibilities include Browse and selecting donations, scheduling pickup, and providing feedback after collection.
