## üåü Introduction

[cite_start]Food wastage is a significant global issue, particularly in urban areas where restaurants and events often have surplus edible food[cite: 1]. [cite_start]Simultaneously, many individuals and communities face food insecurity and hunger[cite: 2].

[cite_start]This project introduces an **AI-Powered Food Redistribution System**, a digital platform that serves as a bridge between food donors (Senders) and receivers like NGOs or shelters (Receivers)[cite: 3, 4]. [cite_start]Our goal is to redistribute surplus food smartly and efficiently, minimizing waste and supporting sustainable food management[cite: 7].

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   [cite_start]**Separate Dashboards:** Dedicated login and dashboard interfaces for both Senders and Receivers[cite: 15].
-   [cite_start]**Food Donation Listings:** Senders can easily upload details of surplus food, including type, quantity, shelf life, and images[cite: 5, 10].
-   [cite_start]**Real-Time Notifications:** Receivers are instantly notified about new, nearby food donations via email (SMTP)[cite: 6, 25, 26].
-   [cite_start]**AI-Powered Matching:** An intelligent engine matches donations with the most suitable receivers based on location, food type, and preferences[cite: 7, 21].
-   [cite_start]**Image Analysis:** A lightweight AI model assesses uploaded images to check for food freshness[cite: 12].
-   [cite_start]**Feedback System:** A simple rating and review system allows receivers to provide feedback on donations[cite: 11, 15].
-   [cite_start]**Admin Analytics:** An administrative overview panel for tracking all platform activity and generating data analytics[cite: 15].

## üß† Why an AI-Powered System?

The integration of Artificial Intelligence elevates the platform's efficiency and effectiveness:

-   [cite_start]**Smart Matching:** Our AI recommends the best receivers for a donation by analyzing historical data, location, and food preferences[cite: 12]. We use a `RandomForestRegressor` model from Scikit-learn for this task.
-   [cite_start]**Demand Prediction:** The system uses a **Prophet** model to forecast areas that will have a high demand for food at specific times, allowing for proactive planning[cite: 13].
-   [cite_start]**Anomaly Detection:** AI helps maintain platform integrity by detecting fraudulent activities or unusual user behavior, such as repeated cancellations, using threshold-based checks[cite: 14, 22].
-   [cite_start]**Image Classification:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) provides a preliminary check on whether an uploaded food image appears fresh or spoiled[cite: 12, 20].

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The platform is built on a modular, layered architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

</p>

-   **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React.js**. [cite_start]It handles user registration, login, food upload forms, and donation Browse[cite: 17, 18].
-   **Application Layer (Backend):** The core logic is powered by **Django**. [cite_start]It manages user sessions, REST APIs, and business logic, and communicates with the AI engine[cite: 19].
-   [cite_start]**AI/ML Engine:** This layer houses our intelligent models for matching, prediction, and detection[cite: 20].
-   [cite_start]**Data Layer:** Securely stores all platform data, including user profiles, donations, and ratings, using a **MySQL** database[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Food images are managed via cloud or local file storage[cite: 24].
-   [cite_start]**Notification Layer:** Handles all user communications, sending real-time alerts about new donations via **SMTP Email**[cite: 25].

-   Node.js and npm
-   MySQL Server

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Backend Setup**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to backend directory
    cd backend
    # Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
